                  Jimmy brought my grandmother's 1927 Steinway baby grand back to life after it sat untouched
                  for nearly fifteen years in our Hyde Park home. His expertise from Berklee College combined
                  with his genuine passion for restoration made all the difference. The piano now holds pitch
                  beautifully and has regained its warm, resonant tone. He worked within our family's budget
                  and treated this heirloom with the reverence it deserved.

            <div className="faq-list">
              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>How often should my piano be tuned?</h4>
                <p>
                  Most pianos should be tuned at least once or twice a year to maintain
                  optimal performance. Pianos in concert settings or heavy use may require
                  more frequent tuning. If your piano hasn't been tuned in over 5 years,
                  it will typically require two tunings to properly hold pitch.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>How much does piano tuning cost?</h4>
                <p>
                  Piano tuning ranges from $100-$200, depending on your location and the
                  condition of your piano. Minor sticky key adjustments during a regular
                  tuning are included in the tuning rate ($150-$200). More extensive repairs
                  requiring parts replacement may cost $100-$200 for 1-2 hours of labor.
                </p>

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Can you repair stuck or sticky keys?</h4>
                <p>
                  Yes! Sticky key repairs are a specialty. Minor adjustments can often be
                  made during a regular tuning appointment. For more extensive repairs
                  requiring parts replacement, additional time and cost may be involved.

                  Absolutely. Jimmy specializes in restoring antique and estate pianos,
                  often salvaging instruments that others have deemed unplayable. Every

              <div className="faq-item">
                <h4>Why does my piano need multiple tunings if it hasn't been tuned in years?</h4>
                <p>
                  Pianos that have been in fluctuating temperatures or haven't been tuned
                  in 5+ years typically require two tunings. The first brings the piano
                  closer to pitch, and the second (done after the piano has settled) ensures
                  it holds that pitch properly over time.
